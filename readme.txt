Enable and disable the Debug Bar with a keystroke: ctrl + d.

== Description ==

The [Debug Bar](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/debug-bar/) plugin is great, but sometimes I want to turn it off for a short time.  This plugin lets you do that with a keystroke (`ctrl` + `d`).

Each time you press the keystroke, it toggles the Debug Bar's setting for your *next* request.  For example, if the Debug Bar is on and you press `ctrl` + `d`, then reload the page, it will not be loaded on the next pageview.  Press `ctrl` + `d` again, refresh, and it's back.

== Installation ==

This plugin doesn't have any options.  Install it, activate it, and it's on.
